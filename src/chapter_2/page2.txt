Git fetch, update and pull
•To check if the remote repository has any changes that our local
repository does not have, we can fetch
•Fetch will bring the new data without added to our local project right away
•To update your local repository with the new changes from the
remote we can pull
•Pulling is more flexible. We will see later
•Branch to branch
•Updating will apply changes to the same branch
